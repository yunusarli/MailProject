# MailProject

In this project i created a mail service connected to the database. This is actually not a real mail service.

* First of all, go to the project3 folder and open up the url and views files. There is an api for getting and setting mails.
In this project, we connected to the database and manipulated this emails via javascript. Go to the mail folder and open up the inbox.js.

* this is an example of a single page application. We reached the data using the fetch api and did our operations on a single page without changing our url connection.
* This project is the 3rd assignment of cs50 web development course. For more information visit (here)[https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/3/mail/]
